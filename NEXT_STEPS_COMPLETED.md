## What You Can Do Now

### 1. Test All Dashboards
```bash
npm run dev
```

Login as different roles:
- admin@hospital.com / admin123 - See admin dashboard
- doctor@hospital.com / doctor123 - See doctor dashboard
- nurse@hospital.com / nurse123 - See nurse dashboard
- pharmacist@hospital.com / pharma123 - See pharmacy dashboard
- lab@hospital.com / lab123 - See lab dashboard
- radio@hospital.com / radio123 - See radiology dashboard
- finance@hospital.com / finance123 - See finance dashboard
- hr@hospital.com / hr123 - See HR dashboard
- patient@hospital.com / patient123 - See patient portal
- auditor@hospital.com / auditor123 - See audit dashboard (not yet implemented)

### 2. Use the Forms

The forms are components you can import and use anywhere:

```typescript
import { PatientRegistrationForm } from './components/forms/PatientRegistrationForm';
import { AppointmentBookingForm } from './components/forms/AppointmentBookingForm';

// In your component
<PatientRegistrationForm
  onSuccess={(patient) => console.log('Created:', patient)}
  onCancel={() => console.log('Cancelled')}
/>
```

### 3. Use the API Services

```typescript
import { getPatients, createPatient, searchPatients } from './services/api';

// Fetch all patients
const patients = await getPatients();

// Search
const results = await searchPatients('John');

// Create new patient
const newPatient = await createPatient({
  first_name: 'John',
  last_name: 'Doe',
  // ... other fields
});
```

### 4. Access the Database

Your Supabase database is live with:
- URL: https://vqulemqircstamxgrzlx.supabase.co
- All tables created and secured
- Sample data can be added via forms or SQL
- Full PostgreSQL access via Supabase dashboard
